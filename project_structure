project
\_ conf\   --> configuration files (Unix/Linux projects might prefer an 'etc' folder)
\_ src\    --> main source (for C++ projects, headers and sources go along, but if 
              your project is a library then separating include files for others 
              is a better practice)
\_ src\module1\ --> for each sub module (for multiple files having related contents,
                   it is better to separate them to their own subfolders)
\_ doc\    --> documentation 
\_ include\ --> (for library projects, the distributable include files)
\_ os\     --> OS (platform dependent) files (uch as makefiles, package building
              scripts..)
\_ res\    --> resources required for compilation but not source files (icons, etc.)
\_ MAKEFILE --> makefile script for building the project
\_ README   --> introductory document (might refer to doc\README)
\_ INSTALL  --> Installation document (might refer to doc\INSTALL)
